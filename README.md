### Different Consecutive Characters CC:

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes a binary string of length N as input. The goal is to count how many insertions are needed so that no two consecutive characters are the same (i.e., the string alternates between 0 and 1). The logic is to go through the string from the second character to the last, and whenever the current character is the same as the one before it, that means an extra character needs to be inserted in between to make them different — so we increase the counter operations.

At the end of the loop for each test case, the program prints the number of insertions required. For example, in the string "00100", the first two characters are "00" (same), so 1 operation is needed. Later in the string, there's another "00" (same), so we need another insertion, totaling 2 operations. This simple logic ensures we only count adjacent duplicates and compute the exact number of insertions needed.


Absolutely! Here’s a **detailed explanation** of the C++ code for the “Different Consecutive Characters” problem:

---

### **Problem Restatement**

You are given a binary string `S` of length `N` (only consisting of `'0'`s and `'1'`s). You want to make sure **no two consecutive characters are the same**. To achieve this, you can insert any character (`'0'` or `'1'`) anywhere in the string. Your task is to find the **minimum number of insertions** required.

---

### **Intuition Behind the Solution**

* When two consecutive characters are the same (like `"00"` or `"11"`), you have to insert at least **one character** between them to separate them and break the repetition.
* For every pair of consecutive identical characters, **one insertion** is needed.
* For example, `"11"` needs one insertion → `"101"` or `"1101"`.
* If there are multiple consecutive repeats like `"111"`, the pairs are `"11"` and `"11"` again, so you need two insertions total.

### **How the Code Works Step-by-Step**

```cpp
int T;
cin >> T;
```

* Reads the number of test cases.

---

```cpp
while (T--) {
    int N;
    string S;
    cin >> N >> S;
```

* For each test case, read the length `N` and the binary string `S`.

---

```cpp
    int operations = 0;
```

* Initialize a counter `operations` to 0 to count the number of insertions required.

---

```cpp
    for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
        if (S[i] == S[i - 1]) {
            operations++;
        }
    }
```

* Loop through the string starting from index 1 (second character).
* Compare current character `S[i]` with the previous character `S[i-1]`.
* If they are the same (for example, both `'0'` or both `'1'`), increment `operations` by 1.
* This means for every pair of identical adjacent characters, one insertion is necessary.

---

```cpp
    cout << operations << endl;
}
```

* After checking the whole string, print the total number of insertions needed for this test case.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**

Consider the string: `S = "00100"`

* Index 0 and 1: `'0'` and `'0'` → same → operations = 1
* Index 1 and 2: `'0'` and `'1'` → different → no insertion needed
* Index 2 and 3: `'1'` and `'0'` → different → no insertion needed
* Index 3 and 4: `'0'` and `'0'` → same → operations = 2

Final output: `2` insertions needed.

---

### **Summary**

The key insight is that **each pair of consecutive identical characters requires exactly one insertion** to break the repetition. Counting these pairs directly gives the minimum number of insertions needed. The code efficiently checks each adjacent pair once, so it runs in O(N) time per test case, which is efficient for the input constraints.
